# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.  
_See [wedding.rampatra.com](http://wedding.rampatra.com/) for a demo. Use invite code `271117` to RSVP._

# Highlights
1. Slick and fully __responsive__ design.
2. __RSVP feature__ which directly uploads data to a Google sheet.
3. __Receive email alerts__ when someone RSVPs.
4. __Add to Calendar__ feature which supports four different calendars.
5. __Book Uber__ button lets guests book a cab to the venue with just a single tap.
6. Start and run the website __completely free__. No hosting, backend server, or database required as you can
use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and Google sheets (with the help of Google scripts) to store rsvp data.

# Getting Started
1. `$ cd wedding-website` - go inside the project directory
2. `$ npm install` - install dependencies _(optional)_
3. `$ gulp` - compile sass to css, minify js, etc. _(optional)_
4. That's it, open `index.html` on your browser by just double-clicking on the file.

# Documentation (pending...)
Will add detailed instructions soon about Uber API and other configurations on this website but for now, you can follow
this [article](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server) to setup your Google sheet
for rsvp feature.

# About Me
Hello, my name is Ram. I am a Software Engineer at [Verizon Media](https://www.verizonmedia.com/). I enjoy making teeny tiny applications in
my leisure time and this is one of them. Now that my wedding is over, I am open-sourcing it. Hope you like it!
