# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.  
_See [wedding.rampatra.com](http://wedding.rampatra.com/) for a demo. Use invite code `271117` to RSVP._

# Highlights
1. Slick and fully __responsive__ design.
2. __RSVP feature__ which directly uploads data to a Google sheet.
3. __Receive email alerts__ when someone RSVPs.
4. __Add to Calendar__ feature which supports four different calendars.
5. __Book Uber__ button lets guests book a cab to the venue with just a single tap.
6. A nice __Youtube video__ showing your venue.
7. __Google Map__ showing your venue's location.
8. Start and run the website __completely free__. No hosting, backend server, or database required as you can use
   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and Google sheets (with the help of Google scripts) to store RSVP
   data.

# Getting Started
1. `$ cd wedding-website` - go inside the project directory

customize each of them according to your needs.

# About Me
Hello, my name is Ram. I am a Lead Software Engineer at [Mastercard R&D Labs](https://www.mastercard.com/). I enjoy making teeny tiny applications in
my leisure time and this is one of them. Now that my wedding is over, I am open-sourcing the project. Hope you like it!

Lastly, if you use a Mac then you may also love [Presentify](https://presentify.compzets.com/). Give it a whirl and let me know your thoughts.
